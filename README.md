Before starting the project, you can create a seperate python environment and activate it, so that we can install all the required dependencies within the environment.

#### 1. Create a Seperate Environment

```bash
  python -m venv env
```

#### 2. Activate Environment

```bash
  env/Scripts/activate
```

#### 3. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Configure API Keys in .env

```bash
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "XXXXXX"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT = "MyProject"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "XXXXXX"
```
